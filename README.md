# NewsApp Android Application

NewsApp is an Android application that allows users to read and explore various articles from trusted sources. It follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which helps in separating business logic, UI, and data components in a structured and maintainable manner.

## Features

- Responsive user interface design with XML layouts and utilizing styles and themes for consistent and appealing visuals.
- Implementation of the Repository component to fetch and store news data from external sources.
- Communication with API servers using Retrofit and storing data in a Room Database for offline reading experience.
- Efficient implementation of a RecyclerView adapter to display a scrollable list of news articles.
- Integration of image loading libraries like Glide or Picasso to load and display related images for each news article.
- Handling user interactions by implementing click handlers on the news list and directing users to engaging article detail pages.
- Share functionality allowing users to share articles with others.
